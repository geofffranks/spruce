## Setting up the environment

To set up the repository, run:

```sh
$ ./scripts/bootstrap
$ ./scripts/lint
```

This will install all the required dependencies and build the SDK.

You can also [install Go 1.25 or later manually](https://go.dev/doc/install).
CI tests every supported Go release line with `GOTOOLCHAIN=local`, so
contributors should not rely on automatic toolchain downloads to satisfy the
repository's minimum version.

## Modifying/Adding code

Most of the SDK is generated code. Modifications to code will be persisted between generations, but may
result in merge conflicts between manual patches and changes from the generator. The generator will never
modify the contents of the `lib/` and `examples/` directories.

## Adding and running examples

All files in the `examples/` directory are not modified by the generator and can be freely edited or added to.

```go
# add an example to examples/<your-example>/main.go

package main

func main() {
  // ...
}
```

```sh
$ go run ./examples/<your-example>
```

## Using the repository from source

To use a local version of this library from source in another project, edit the `go.mod` with a replace
directive. This can be done through the CLI with the following:

```sh
$ go mod edit -replace github.com/openai/openai-go=/path/to/openai-go
```

## Running tests

Most tests require you to [set up a mock server](https://github.com/dgellow/steady) against the OpenAPI spec to run the tests.

```sh
$ ./scripts/mock
```

```sh
$ ./scripts/test
```

## Formatting

This library uses the standard `go fmt` command. Run it in each module that
contains Go source:

```sh
$ go fmt ./...
$ go -C examples fmt ./...
$ go -C internal/testdata/consumer fmt ./...
```

The [Go code quality policy](GO_CODE_QUALITY_POLICY.md) describes the staged
formatting and static-analysis rules for generated and handwritten code.
