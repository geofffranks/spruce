#
# Spruce tests for the `spruce diff` utility
#
# This file defines a set of tests for exercising the
# functionality of the `spruce diff` utility.
#
# Each test starts with '### (test name)' and runs
# until the next '### ...', or end-of-file, whichever
# comes first.
#
# The first YAML document between the '###' delimiters
# will be diff'd against the second YAML document, and
# the output of that operation compared against the
# text following the third '---' delimiters.
#
# This should make it trivial to add new diff tests
# for edge cases, as they crop up, without having
# to write a ton of dense golang testing code.
#
# OH! If you want to just run this test, interactively,
# you can do so with the following `go test` invocation:
#
#    go test -run Diff | cat
#
# (the '|cat' but is in there to forcibly disable the
#  ANSI colorizing you get when running `spruce diff`)
#
# Happy Testing!
